Copy from Makefile:
qemu-nox-gdb:
        qemu-system-i386 -nographic -s -S os.img

gdb:
        gdb -n -x ./.gdbconf/.gdbinit

linux instruction pattern :

qemu-system-i386
-s  Shorthand for -gdb tcp::1234, i.e. open a gdbserver on TCP port 1234.
-S  Do not start CPU at startup (you must type 'c' in the monitor).
-nographic
           Normally, if QEMU is compiled with graphical window support, it
           displays output such as guest graphics, guest console, and the QEMU
           monitor in a window. With this option, you can totally disable
           graphical output so that QEMU is a simple command line application.
           The emulated serial port is redirected on the console and muxed with
           the monitor (unless redirected elsewhere explicitly). Therefore, you
           can still use QEMU to debug a Linux kernel with a serial console. Use
           C-a h for help on switching between the console and monitor.

gdb:
-n  Do not execute commands from any .gdbinit initialization files.
-x file
           Execute GDB commands from file file.
