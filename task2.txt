EXERCISE 13:
cat is short for catenate.
The command line "cat bootloader/bootloader.bin app/app.bin > os.img" means:
catenate the two .bin files to a while and print it to os.img
If we do some changes to the Makefile, we can get a cat.bin file with the cat result. Then just hexdump it. It's easy to find the cat.bin is the combination of the origin .bin files, with app.bin directly following bootloader.bin.
As a result, if we view cat.bin as a simulation of disk, the bootloader.bin is sector 0 and app.bin is sector 1, which is important to implement boot.c.


EXERCISE 14:
No.
The BIOS is start from 0x7c00 and occupies 512 bytes.
According to objdump and ls -al, we find app.bin is 58 bytes.
But the readSect function read in 512 bytes, and it will cover itself with noncode, so the function won't work.
